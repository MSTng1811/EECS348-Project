Development plan between all team members in a shared word document that everyone can update live. Next, we established 
roles for each member of the group.  The roles for each team member are listed below. After establishing our roles, we 
started going through the project development plan and started talking about what we want it to look like and how we want 
it to work. Next, we started going through each segment of the Software Development Plan together and discussing what to 
write down for each step of the development process.We also edited the cover page for the project, and picked a team
