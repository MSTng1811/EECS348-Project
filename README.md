This is a respository to store all the contents of our group project "Boolean Logic Simulator".
The purpose of this project is to create a Boolean Logic Simulator by exploring concepts of logic gates,
truth tables and expression evaluation. The program will simulate how Boolean operators are interacted with
and will return a Boolean calculation. The expected output will be software that takes in a Boolean equation,
solves it and returns an output.

Given below are the team members of the project:-
1. Mark Maloney (Project Leader)
2. Aiden Burke (Assistant Project Leader)
3. Ty Farrington (Records Manager)
4. Brett Suhr (Quality Assurance Engineer)
5. Muskan Sharma (Technical Manager)

The repository will be regularly updated with required materials at a specific phase of the project along with
the logs of all the discussions and iterations carried out in the code.
